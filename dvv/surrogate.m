function Xs = surrogate(X, Ns)
% Generates surrogate data for real and complex signals
% 
% Surrogate data generation using iterated amplitude adjusted fourier
% transform (iAAFT) method for real-valued series, and complex iAAFT method
% for complex series.

% USAGE:    Xs = surrogate(X, Ns)
%
% INPUTS:
% X:        Input time series (can be real-valued or complex)
% Ns:       No. of surrogates to be generated
%
% OUTPUTS:
% Xs:   Generated surrogates
